This code creates a sarcasm (and sentiment) detection web app using pytorch, streamlit, and the twitter api.

At the moment, this repo does not contain the file for the creation of the embedding vector, as this file exceeds the filesize limitations of git. That file can be downloaded here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.twitter.27B.zip
 
In addition, this app uses my personal twitter API dev credentials which are not present in the file. In order to fetch tweets via the twitter API, you must 
provide your own twitter dev credentials as environmental variables.
